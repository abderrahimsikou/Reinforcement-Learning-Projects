# CartPole-v1 PPO Agent(Reinforcement Learning Project)

## Description
This project implements a reinforcement learning agent using the PPO algorithm to solve the CartPole-v1 envionment from OpenAI Gym.The implementation is based on the Stable-Baseslines3 library.
the objective  is to balance a pole on a cart by applying forces to the left or right.
